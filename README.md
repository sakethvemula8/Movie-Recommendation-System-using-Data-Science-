# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Data-Science-

## 📌 Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is built using **machine learning techniques** to suggest movies based on user preferences and past interactions. The project is implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** and leverages **data science and AI algorithms** to provide accurate recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and normalizes data.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**:
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies based on movie attributes (genre, director, etc.).
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user interactions to find similar preferences.
  - **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple recommendation techniques for better accuracy.
- **Visualization of Movie Trends**: Provides charts and graphs to analyze movie popularity and trends.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple workflow for generating recommendations within Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📖 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Load the dataset in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the notebook to train and generate movie recommendations.

## 📊 Dataset
- The project uses a **publicly available movie dataset** (e.g., **MovieLens, IMDB, TMDB**).
- Ensure that the dataset is in the correct directory before running the notebook.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleans and preprocesses movie data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful insights from the dataset.
3. **Model Training**: Uses recommendation algorithms to find patterns.
4. **Generate Recommendations**: Suggests personalized movie lists for users.
5. **Evaluation**: Measures the performance of the recommendation system.
